**Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube dislikes data using Pandas.**

**Domain: Social media**

**Data Description:**

YouTube Dislikes Dataset:

● This dataset contains information about trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021
for the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.

● This dataset contains the latest possible information about dislikes,likes,views and more which was
collected just before December 13. The information was collected by videos that had been trending in
the USA, Canada, and Great Britain for a year prior.

**Objective:**

In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it announced the decision to hide the
number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed to
get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen
insights from this dataset.

**Task:**

To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using numpy and pandas libraries and drive
meaningful insights by performing Exploratory data analysis.

**Result:**

Here's a concise summary of the key findings from the YouTube Dislike Dataset project:

Unique Counts: The analysis revealed the total counts of unique video IDs, channel IDs, and channel titles, providing insight into the dataset's diversity.

Top and Bottom Channels: The top 10 channels with the highest video counts were identified, alongside the bottom 10 channels with the lowest counts, offering a glimpse into prolific creators and lesser-known channels.

Impact of Views on Dislikes: Examination of the relationship between views and dislikes unveiled potential dynamics in audience engagement.

Monthly Publication Trends: Trends in video publication rates were observed over time, shedding light on patterns in content creation activity.

Extreme Liked and Disliked Videos: The titles of videos with the highest and lowest numbers of likes and dislikes were highlighted, showcasing notable examples within the dataset.

RelationshiP between views and dislikes: The scatter plot, showing that videos with higher view counts generally tend to have higher dislike counts.
Thus, we can conclude that the number of views does have an effect on how many people disliked the video, with more views generally leading to more dislikes.
