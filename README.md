**Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube data using Pandas.**

**Domain: Social media**

**Context and Content:**

In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it announced the decision to hide the
number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to
get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen
insights from this dataset.

**Objective:**

To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using numpy and pandas libraries and drive
meaningful insights by performing Exploratory data analysis.
